# BlurNet
# 🕵️‍♂️ Face Anonymizer using OpenCV & MediaPipe

This project provides a simple, effective way to anonymize faces in images, videos, and webcam streams using OpenCV and MediaPipe's face detection module.

## 🚨 Problem

In a world driven by visual content, protecting personal privacy is a growing concern. Whether it's social media, surveillance footage, or public datasets, showing identifiable faces without consent can violate privacy regulations and ethical standards.

## ✅ Solution

This tool automatically detects and anonymizes human faces by applying a blur effect, ensuring that individuals' identities are protected. It works in three modes:
- **Image Mode**: Processes a single image and saves the anonymized output.
- **Video Mode**: Processes an entire video file and outputs a new video with blurred faces.
- **Webcam Mode**: Runs real-time face anonymization on live webcam feed.

## 🛠️ Features
